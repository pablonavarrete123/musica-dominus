Now that I have lost my earthly father, I know that our spiritual Father, the Creator of all this universe, did not create freedom for us, for he created Man with the freedom to free himself. True freedom is not found on the beaches of Panama or those of Costa Rica, nor in the great savannah, in the arms of a pretty Venezuelan. Freedom is freedom only if we create it for the voice of nature constantly resounds in man a call to live not for God and for other men but for himself alone, selfishly, like the other beings of nature who live according to their instinct. documenting myself and by reading my father's spiritual books, written by François Varillon and Maurice Zundel, I understood that there is n the man (and the woman) a double force: on the one hand, a force of gravity and inertia which invites him to give up being a free man and pushes him to live like the other beings of the world who have no freedom to build. And on the other hand, an upward force that invites him to build his freedom that God, by grace, will give access to his own freedom. True freedom is found in divinity, welcoming Christ into one's heart by living according to his example, by denying oneself. Two great examples of free men were Francis of Assisi or Charles de Foucault, who led their lives by sharing with others and living for others. So few of us simple sinners can reach such a level of holiness and divinity, it is necessary for us to modify our behavior towards others. Because the essence of sin is to trigger a train of waves that disrupt human relationships. Every bad action or thought is a provocation to the evil that we deposit in the conscience of others.",

By living in a world bathed in extreme acidity (degraded food, vulgarity, selfishness, acoustic contamination, air pollution , water and spirit), it is necessary to balance by eating cereals, plants, fruits, which I will name: alkaline diet.

For beginners, mostly children: it forces you to do function the two parts of the brain.The left part of the brain corresponds to logic, it will process the functional, mathematical aspect of music, such as the division of sounds into half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, semi eighth notes etc... The right part of the brain will deal with art, melody, singing! Because let's not forget that playing the piano is simply making your instrument sing! By managing to coordinate the two hands, we will achieve harmony. It is almost a matter of a struggle between the head (left hand) and the heart (right hand) between melodic expansion and rhythmic tension, between structure and reverie. Most interesting is the reversal, passing the melody to the left hand and the rhythm to the right…",
